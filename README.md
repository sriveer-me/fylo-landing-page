## My process

I started with analyzing both the mobile and desktop design of this website.
Next, I started working on markup primarily focusing on the desktop design of the site.
Once the markup was in place, it was time to first style the mobile version.
Having been satisfied with how the mobile version turned out, I began to make necessary additions so as to make the site responsive on desktop.
Final touchups included some js to check input validation and hover effects.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
